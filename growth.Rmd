# Introduction

Consider the following model of forest growth (where forest size in measured in units of carbon (C)):

-   dC/dt = r ∗ C for forests

    -   where C is below a threshold canopy closure

    -   and *r* is the early exponential growth rate

-   dC/dt = g ∗ (1−C/K) for forests

    -   where C is at or above the threshold canopy closure

    -   and *g* is the linear growth rate

-   and *K* is a carrying capacity in units of carbon.

The size of the forest (C), canopy closure threshold, and carrying capacity (K) are all in units of carbon.

You could think of the canopy closure threshold as the size of the forest at which growth rates change from exponential to linear.

You can think of *r*, as early exponential growth rate and *g* as the linear growth rate once canopy closure has been reached

# 1. Implement this model in R (as a differential equation)

```{r}
source(here("R", "forest_growth.R"))


```

# 2. Run the model for 300 years (using the ODE solver) starting with an initial forest size of 10 kg/C, and using the following parameters:

-   canopy closure threshold of 50 kgC

-   *K* = 250 kg C (carrying capacity)

-   *r* = 0.01 (exponential growth rate before before canopy closure)

-   *g* = 2 kg/year (linear growth rate after canopy closure)

## Graph the results.

```{r}

```

# 3. Run a sobol sensitivity analysis that explores how the estimated maximum and mean forest size (e.g maximum and mean values of C over the 300 years) varies with the pre canopy closure growth rate (*r*) and post-canopy closure growth rate (*g*) and canopy closure threshold and carrying capacity(*K*)

Assume that parameters are all normally distributed with means as given above and standard deviation of 10% of mean value.

```{r}

```

## Graph the results of the sensitivity analysis as a box plot of maximum forest size and a plot of the two Sobol indices (S and T).

```{r}

```

# 4. In 2-3 sentences, discuss what the results of your simulation might mean for climate change impacts on forest growth (e.g think about what parameters climate change might influence ).
